				<h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
				<!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
				<p>Since this site is aimed towards the more mature audience, we will find that the general viewing public will be around the age of early 20's to late 70's and therefore the general income will be around $45,000 - $90,000, the education level will be highschool level and higher and the Locationwise, the public can be anywhere with an internet connection.
                The way CNN meets the needs of its viewers is that they don't shove every single story that is current into their front page. Instead, they set everything up with links leading to each story which means the every page will be personalized with its own story versus the main page being buried under the amount of stories that CNN keeps an eye on. This is like the Hierarchy Typography layout in action, with the breaking news at the top and the other more relevent stories underneath the main topic. By keeping every page personal, the principle of Less is More is kept and applied.
                Using CNN on a mobile format was enjoyable because I was not bombarded by videos galore unlike cnn.com on a laptop. On a laptop, their site is stacked with videos and articles everywhere, yet in an organized format. On the mobile format, the experience was very straightforward. You saw the breaking news at the top, then you scroll down to see links to the other relevent news and links to the other sections of CNN.com. 
                I felt that CNN.com facilitated an enjoyable experience on mobile. The site takes the visitor into consideration by making the site easy to read (on a mobile, anyway) and insightful, yet not stuffed full of information. If the visitor wants to see news on Trump's election polls, they can find it right on the front home page or search for it in the search bar in the top right corner. If the viewer wants news about a different area or nation, they have the option as well to change the area in which to focus the news. Overall typology-wise, It was a pleasant experience to read what's going on in the world.

				<h2>Persona</h2>

Some of his hobbies include watching the news and discussing politics with his brother-in-law who is a lawyer and debating the best implementation plans for different laws of the future.
                    His environment is one of quiet cubicle work, searching the Internet for new ideas to propose towards the company president and catching up on the latest technology news.

				<h3>Site Content</h3>
				<!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the persona reading to build a persona for this site-->
				<p> Did they or did they not know who their target audience was?
                    Even though the site was made with college students in mind, I have to feel stupid when I look at this site. I can't tell if their target audience was college students or middle school students with mental issues due to the moving background behind the content.
Did they or did they not meet the needs of their audience? I suppose they met their viewers' needs if their needs were to find a silly page to look into for enrolling in an art school. But the background was quite distracting and I found some of their text, such as the address of the school, hard to notice on first glance.
Did they or did they not organize content to facilitate it being found? Their organization was not well done. They had all the information posted on it in random positions as you progressed down the page.  
Did the site facilitate visitors in a mobile environment? Admittedly, I suppose yes. You could scroll through the page without having issues with reading it. However, it was hard to pick out the important news from all the distractions.        </p>
