			<h2>Audience Description &mdash; <!-- Replace this comment with the team member name responsible for proximity --></h2>
			<p>The expected audience description for this site is to made of outdoorsmen. What I mean by this is that people who wish to have fun outdoors or plan family trips will be the main viewers. For the outdoor sportsmen/women, this site will contain information about how the weather will be by the hour. This will allow them to prepare for their events. For family trips, the same information will apply. Most of these people will be financially well off, allowing them to travel around. Families will need this site to prepare their materials like sunscreen in order to be ready for the weather of their destinations.

            <img src="../../images/250px-Outdoorsman.png" alt="Mr. Heavy Hunter">
			<p>
				Mr. Heavy is a 34 year old man with an avid love for hunting. He loves to go to the northern reaches of Ohio, as the best game can be found up there. However, he continues to worry about how much warmth he needs to bring to his hunting stand. With this website, Mr. Heavy can prepare for the most likely outcome when preparing for the hunt.
                Since he uses his phone in order to call around and as a GPS, Mr. Heavy uses data in order to not get lost and also uses apps that'll allow him to find areas where game have been found.
